# Simon-Says-Game
A simple and interactive memory challenge where the system shows a pattern of colors, and the player must repeat it correctly. Each level adds difficulty by extending the sequence. One mistake ends the game. Fun, responsive, and beginner-friendly, designed to practice logic, focus, and pattern memory.
